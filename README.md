# Sign-Language-Recognition
A Sign Language Recognition Project, A sign detector which detects numbers from 1 to 10. It can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures including the alphabets. This project is developed using OpenCV and Keras modules of python.
This can be very helpful for the deaf and dumb people in communicating with others as knowing sign language is not something that is common to all, moreover, this can be extended to creating automatic editors, where the person can easily write by just their hand gestures. 

The prerequisites software & libraries for the sign language project are:
Python (3.7.4)
IDE (Jupyter)
Numpy (version 1.16.5)
cv2 (openCV) (version 3.4.2)
Keras (version 2.3.1)
Tensorflow (as keras uses tensorflow in backend and for image preprocessing) (version 2.0.0)

Three Main Steps:
Creating the dataset
Training a CNN on the captured dataset
Predicting the data
